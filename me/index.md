My name is **Jose Miguel** and I want to thank you very much for reading thru all of these entries or looking at this.

Currently I am a software engineer 💻 from Mexico, I work as a remote engineer for a startup in San Francisco,  
in different languages, Java and Ruby mostly, but other than Software my favorite topics include:

- Music 🎼🎸🎹 - A total Amateur but I like to discover this world.
- Video games 🎮 - Dark Souls, Fallout, Harvest Moon are my favorites.
- Food 🍴 - discovering tasty food is one thing but... cooking delicious recipes? that's better!, I prepare a very good tzatziki with home-made greek yogurt!
- Movies 🎥 - if it is bad, probably it is good for me, my favorite movie is American Pie.
- Running 🏃‍ - let's go for a walk or a run, I really like that! My longer distance is 10 km in 1:10 hours.
- Travel ✈ - I like to live my ordinary life in non-common places, just ping me, maybe I can visit you.

If you have an interesting project involving any of these topics, you could <a href="mailto:jose@otfusion.org">contact me</a> and let's talk!
