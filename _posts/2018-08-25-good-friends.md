## Hey!

Yesterday I had the worst day (until now) in my life, I lost the **most** important person in my life, something changed between us and we just decided that it was the best for us to continue different paths and say goodbye.

I hope that she finds what she is looking for, I want her to be happy, I will continue with my life and look for opportunities to develop myself as a person, it is gonna be very hard but it is something that I have to do.

I dont know how I am gonna do it, I have no idea where am I standing right now but I think that's part of the adventure, I know that I am here and now, I cant look back and I cant keep my thoughts in the future so I will start just by being with my good friends and start moving along with the flow.

The good part of this post is that I have very good friends, I share with them all my thoughts and they are helping me in this moment, if any of you read this: **thank you amigos**.

If **you** are reading this, **I love you, be happy, I will try too**. :)
