## Hola!

Last week I created a playlist for my teenager myself, since someone deleted all my playlists from 
Spotify this year.

*Sigh*, I know, I used to have my playlists very organized and everything but those are gone, no problem.

I retrieved most of the playlists I created but no more organization, I just grabbed all the music 
and moved them to a playlist folder named: "Nostalgia" and "Old" and I started again to organize my music 
creating a playlist per month.

I also created a few more with different "flavors" hah, one of my favorites:
`My teenage`

Oh boi, here we go again.

I listen to this while running.

And for you, that I hope that you are still reading me somehow as I do:
