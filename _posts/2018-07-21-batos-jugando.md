Some friends of mine and me have been streaming our video game sessions, normally we play at night but sometimes it takes the entire afternoon, we call ourselves: **Batos Jugando**, you can find us over different streaming platforms, but mostly we stream now to [Twitch](https://twitch.tv/batosjugando).
