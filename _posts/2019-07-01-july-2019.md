## June

### Problem Solving

June was a very good month, I did not felt that much bad emotionally.

- I started again writing in my diary, that's good and I wrote a lot about my food now!
- I have my recipes in a notebook too now! (and internet of course internet.).

### Podcast!

I continued with Tony doing the podcast each week, right now I am waiting for him to start recording, 
maybe we will do it other day but that's nice, 6 episodes are a lot.

You can listen to it here:

Also, we have a new website: https://batosjugando.com the inside joke is that: "batos" is "guys" and "jugando" is playing 
so if our podcast fails we always can create a same sex porn site... or something like that.


### Monthly playlist
I've been creating a playlist each month of this year, I will start sharing those here or in my main site? dunno... ðŸŽ¶
