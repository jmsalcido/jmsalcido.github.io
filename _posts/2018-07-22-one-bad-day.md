## Hey!

![image of the joker][image]

Lately I've been feeling very bad because I quit my job because I was not being that productive as I could have been, I want more in my professional life, I've been very negative and my life has been changed a lot.

One of the things that were on my head all the time was **The Famous Joker quote from The Killing Joke**.

I mean, it is a very bad ass monologue from that guy, I think he is one of the very best villians in existence and probably I am gonna ruin it with a cheesy post, but I dont care.

>The Joker:
>
>So, I see you received the free ticket I sent you.
>
>I'm glad. I did so want you to be here.
>
>You see, it doesn't matter if you catch me and send me back to the Asylum.
>
>Gordon's been driven mad. I've proved my point!
>
>**I've demonstrated that even the sanest man alive can be driven to lunacy! All it takes is one bad day**.
>
>That's how far the world is from where I am. Just one bad day.
>
>You had a bad day once. Am I right? I know I am. You had a bad day, and everything changed! Why else would you dress up as a flying rat?
>
>You had a bad day, and it drove you as crazy as everybody else! Only you won't admit it!

I did not have a single bad day, I had a lot of those.

My problem: I was focussing myself on the very first part only, where the Joker wins.

There is more, this is cheesy AF but I am gonna quote him:

>Batman:
>
> He's fine. Despite all your sick, vicious little games, he's as sane as he ever was. So maybe ordinary people don't always crack. Maybe there isn't any need to crawl under a rock with all the other slimey things when trouble hits. **Maybe it was just you, all the time**.

I mean, it applied to my life in that very insisting moment, I had a very good conversation with the person that actually made me get out of the bad day. I am sane and good.

I hope that person reads this at least once, so I can ruin the Joker and Batman for that person ;)
