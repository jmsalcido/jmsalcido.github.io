## Hey, hola!

In the past year I have asked myself this question a lot.

It is one question that I did not asked myself that regularly because  
 I used to think that I _knew_ the answer.

In my present day (today) I still don't know but I am more close to the  
 answer!.

**WHY**

My ego was in control in the past, my ego, who I will call **Mr B**, used  
to think that he was in control of his career, of his close friends, of his family  
and also of other things.

**Mr B.** was a very bad human being, he did not talk to people, he was angry,  
he was tired and he was nervous and stressed - a lot of stress.

Poor **Mr B.** I don't want you to control my life again.

**PRESENT DAY**

Well, it is quite easy to answer it now, thanks to a friend I learned  
about a certain philosophy and I started to read about different  
schools of thoughts.

I am currently a stoic man, I can claim that because I desire to do it.

I think the stoicism helps me as I am a very neutral person, I am not moved by  
desires, I am moved by the reason and for me that's the most natural thing of a man.

It does not mean that I will follow blindy the stoicism school but I really  
like the meditations from different figures.

I currently read a meditation in the morning and try to be a better person every day.

**HOW CAN I KNOW THAT IT IS NOT MY EGO TALKING?**

Well, that's a very good question, I am not 100% sure, but at least I am now  
observing **Mr B.** instead of just following him, it is impressive the power  
that I have over **Mr B.** now that I observe him, now I can tell when I am angry,  
when I am nervous, when I am doing something that I think is *good* or *bad*.

I can talk better with people now, I can make better relationships and I understand  
my family and friends better, I can feel empathic with them.

And for you, that I hope that you are still reading me somehow as I do:

**Always.**
