## Hola!

My _n_ personal page, I have opened a few blogs in the past and I have my [Medium](https://medium.com/@jmsalcido) profile where I have written a few articles, mostly of these are tech-related but there is something missing.

A few hours ago, my personal domain [otfusion.org](https://otfusion.org) pointed only to my Twitter profile, but I was looking at different sites in the morning that I decided that I should have my own.

**at first I was thinking on:**

- online resume site
- my own crafted site from scratch (I suck at frontend guys)
- a list of mostly non-so-useful links to github (kb-links)
- a simply rails crud blog-like

## Enter Jekyll

Since I dont want to start a site from scratch for a simple blog or a simple crud (I could tho, but I think that's not the point of this site), I decided to use:

[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) and use GitHub pages as host.

I will just point the index of [otfusion.org](https://otfusion.org) to this site and my side projects (I should have some after this very point of time) will be on subdomains.

So that's it, be happy :-)

Also, look at this awesome template for Jekyll that I found out: [windows95](https://h01000110.github.io/windows-95/)

I'll use it!
