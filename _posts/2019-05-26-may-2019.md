## May

### Guadalajara

I will start with the travel of this month, I went to Guadalajara to a music festival named Corona Capital.

Guadalajara is nice, it's a good place where I could live, I liked the trees and the streets, the food and a lot of beautiful people in there.

But I am not moving soon, as far as I know... ðŸ¤—

The important part other than the festival itself is that I saw some good old friends, Marco, Alexander and of course, met some good people there.

### Baking

Ah!, I started baking bread and cheesecakes, I hope that I will get better on those 2, cheesecake is one of my favorite cakes so it is good to be  
able to prepare it by myself.

Also bread, bread is one of our basic foods so I had to learn how to prepare it by myself, from scratch, I will be baking more types on the next months.

We will be posting it on fridays, it is named: **El Hongo Verde**, the Green Mushroom, named like that because of Mario of course, and the "slogan" is  
"La princesa no esta aquÃ­", or "The princess is not here" based on the dialog: "the princess is in another castle" from Toad.

Please enjoy!

### Finishing notes

Enjoy the little things, May is the mental health awareness month, thank you for the reminder, disconnect from social media an entire week, go and connect with your nature (reason)  
and stop listening to the news, be with your friends if that's what you want, listen to your mind and meditate.
