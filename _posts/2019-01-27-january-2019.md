## Hey, hola!

I've been following the Global Game Jams for a while, I think since 2012 but
 the thing is that I never participated on anything.

You know, it is very normal that people from the tech industry at first
 they wanted to create video games because some games let you modify
 it's internals and then you learn to program - example OTFusion:
 we were an bulletin board for the spanish comunity of an open source
 project for private servers of a mmorpg game.

But that's not the point of this entry.

The point is that I decided to participate finally, after 7 years.

But my idea of this time was not to participate as a programmer or a software
 engineer, of course I would help anyone who had issues or questions about
 software engineering/design and language, but not as my main participation.

I decided to participate as a musician.

**WHAT?**

Yep, this time I tried my best as a musician instead of being another programmer.

It started on January 25 at 6:00pm, the topic of this year was:

**WHAT DOES HOME MEAN TO YOU**

And I had an idea! (2 actually). *Yeah, I am the Idea guy too*

- A grilling game because that's home for some people, a bbq with your friends
 or with your family, that's normally on your backyard or frontyard.

Oh welp, we had a blast of 2 days, I was creating and helping other teams too.

I composed 3 songs - *wow, that sounds pretencious AF* and it was fun!

But welp, here you go a link to the game that **Gato Mocho** created:

Also the music in SoundCloud - *I mean, its for basic games, come on*
